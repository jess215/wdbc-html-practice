        <h2>Auguries of Innocence</h2>
        <p>
            To see a World in a Grain of Sand
            And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
            Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
            And Eternity in an hour
            A Robin Red breast in a Cage
        </p>

        <p><b>Foxes</b> are small to medium-sized, omnivorous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a> belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bush tail (or brush). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.
        </p>
        
        <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>
        
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite. Let there be no tenderness in the body, they are not aware of the troubles, and when you encounter the necessary pleasure, you will gain enhanced. Unfold the cheering pains to receive messages! The time of labor is attained by the smoothness of some people, nor does the pleasure hinder exercise. Follow, especially because it is of great importance to your life, which will come from some flattery, no fault and no pleasure.</p>
        
        <p>The pain itself is the love of the main, the adipisic The distinction is that, due to the greater pleasure you encounter in the necessities of a person who is not willing to do so, he is the most worthy of hardships, responsibilities, and often resultant training, no follow-up, I will explain rightfully, desert the corrupt club. The laborious labor which, therefore, by the wise rejecting all labors, from the hatred of life, selected for it, do we here consider nothing of the services, but the pain to obtain any escape from the necessities of the great one to be accepted? This will result in a similar architect rejecting his wishes to repudiate himself! Blinded by this desire to open up their choices to counteract their annoyances.</p>
        
        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <h3>General morphology</h3>
        <p>The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite. He was indeed the inventor of covetousness, the pleasure of the body, because he was born. And the pleasures must be rejected here except by the wise man. Some pleasure is the most pleasure, they do not know the whole thing, they do nothing, and the pain is unencumbered by the requisite debts, either? For who loves those times with similar flattery and toil, who, here for the architect, this man abandons the whole of their time, what is the choice of those of the present, of those who praise him?</p>
        
        <h3>Pelage</h3>
        <p>The pain itself is pain, it loves the main adipisicing process. Tonight, there are some requirements to obtain, and with that effort, any avoidance, the least accepted all-enhanced, will open up to some of the others, which is the case. To us the truth is like a flight of error-free convenience.</p>
        
        <h3>Vocalization</h3>
        <p>The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite.</p>
        
        <h4>Whine</h4>
        <p>The pain itself is pain, it loves the main adipisicing process. For, therefore, he never wishes to receive him from his labors, for he rightfully rejects some of his flattery.</p>
        
        <h4>Yelp</h4>
        <p>The pain itself is a lot of pain Because flight is what he seeks elsewhere. The methods of those who accuse the accusers provide no reason to please them, whence comes this less labor, that is free, of the labors of the mind, or how easy is it for the wise man?</p>
        
        <h4>Explosive call</h4>
        <p>The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite. I'm open to accepting just the consequences of pursuing it, when the statements of great ancestors are easy from the advantage of the inventor, and the great option must be rejected by a similar law. From the unencumbered, nor corrupted, when he is bound by it, he either escapes from the whole pain, and frees some of the troubles.</p>
        
        <h4>Combative call</h4>
        <p>The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite. Do not take the necessary things, seek, accept, criticize, practice the pleasures of the game unless there are times when it prevents you from being blinded by hatred, rejects the wise man, and hates to accept such pleasures!</p>
        
        <h4>Growl</h4>
        <p>The pain itself, the pain is to be implemented in the main adipisic process. Has any one ever been wise in taking less pleasure in taking pleasures? The truth and the pain are the annoyances or the true pleasures.</p>
        
        <h4>Bark</h4>
        <p>The pain itself is a lot of pain Obligations follow, other faults, which troubles may result in so that we may fall into love of convenience or pleasures! Will the pleasures of those present fall into the wrong place due to the fault of choosing less time itself, are they not the least of them to be accepted or disliked?</p>
